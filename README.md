## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots menu → "Custom repositories"
4. Add this repository: `https://github.com/Spettacolo83/homeassistant-diesel-heater`
5. Category: "Integration"
6. Click "Add"
7. Search for "Diesel Heater" and install
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/Spettacolo83/homeassistant-diesel-heater/releases)
2. Copy the `custom_components/diesel_heater` folder to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Troubleshooting

### Heater Not Found / Connection Issues

**1. Unpair from your phone first!**
> The most common issue! If the heater is paired with the Vevor app on your phone, Home Assistant cannot connect.
- Open your phone's Bluetooth settings
- Find the heater device and **forget/unpair** it
- Close the Vevor app completely
- Try adding the integration again

**2. Bluetooth Proxy Connection Limits**
> ESPHome Bluetooth proxies have a maximum of **3-7 simultaneous connections** (varies by ESP32 model).
- Check how many BLE devices are using your proxy
- Consider adding a dedicated ESP32 proxy for the heater
- Or use a USB Bluetooth dongle directly on your HA server

**3. Raspberry Pi 4 Internal Bluetooth Issues**
> The built-in Bluetooth on RPi4 can be unreliable for BLE devices.
- **Recommended**: Use an external USB Bluetooth 5.0 dongle
- **Alternative**: Use an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy (ESP32)
- Disable the internal Bluetooth if using external adapter:
  ```
  # Add to /boot/config.txt
  dtoverlay=disable-bt
  ```

**4. Other Integrations Interfering**
> Some integrations scan for Bluetooth devices aggressively.
- Check if you have other BLE integrations running
- The Bluetooth Integration's passive scanning can cause conflicts
- Try disabling other BLE integrations temporarily to test

**5. Distance and Obstacles**
> Bluetooth LE has limited range, especially through walls.
- Move your Bluetooth adapter/proxy closer to the heater
- ESP32 proxies can be placed near the heater with power over USB
- Metal surfaces and water (including bodies) block BLE signals

### Connection Drops / "Unavailable" Status

**1. Stale Data Tolerance**
> The integration keeps sensor values for 3 polling cycles before showing unavailable.
- Brief disconnections won't affect your automations
- If unavailable persists, check the issues above

**2. Enable Debug Logging**
> Add this to your `configuration.yaml` to see detailed connection logs:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.diesel_heater: debug
    diesel_heater_ble: debug
```

### Temperature Not Changing

**1. Check Running Mode**
> Temperature control only works in **Temperature Mode**.
- Use `select.diesel_heater_running_mode` to switch to "Temperature Mode"
- In "Level Mode", the heater uses fixed power levels instead

**2. Protocol Compatibility**
> Some heaters use Fahrenheit internally (AA66 encrypted).
- The integration auto-detects and converts temperatures
- If issues persist, check the logs for "protocol" messages

### Burn-off on Shutdown

When you turn the heater off (climate, power switch, or fan), the integration can first run at **maximum power** for a configurable duration (default 10 minutes). This helps burn off soot. The previous heating mode and setpoint are restored immediately before the real power-off command, so the next start is not stuck on Level 10.

- Disable with `switch.*_burnoff_on_shutdown` or set duration to skip via **Power Off Now**
- Turning the heater back on during burn-off cancels the delayed off and restores the previous mode
- **Limitation:** ECU Auto Start/Stop can shut the heater down on its own (±2°C). Home Assistant cannot intercept those shutdowns, so they skip burn-off

## Finding Your Heater's MAC Address

Before adding the integration, you need to find your heater's Bluetooth MAC address:

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install bleak
   ```

2. Run the finder script (included in this repo):
   ```bash
   python3 find_heater.py before
   ```

3. **Close the Vevor app** if it's running

4. Open the Vevor app and **connect** to your heater

5. Run the finder script again:
   ```bash
   python3 find_heater.py after
   ```

6. The device that **disappeared** is your heater! Note its MAC address (e.g., `69:96:19:04:59:9B`)

## Configuration

### Add Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **"+ Add Integration"**
3. Search for **"Diesel Heater"**
4. The integration will auto-discover nearby heaters, or you can enter the MAC address manually
5. Enter your heater's **PIN** (default: `1234`, change if you set a custom PIN via the Vevor app)
6. Click **"Submit"**

### Integration Options

After setup, go to the integration's **Configure** button to access these options:

- **PIN**: Change the heater connection PIN
- **Preset Away Temperature**: Target temperature for Away preset (default: 16°C)
- **Preset Comfort Temperature**: Target temperature for Comfort preset (default: 22°C)
- **External Temperature Sensor**: Select an external HA temperature sensor for auto offset adjustment
- **Auto Offset Max**: Maximum offset value when using external sensor (1-9, only shown when external sensor is configured)

## Changelog

### Version 2.1.5-beta.2
- **Burn-off on Shutdown**: Before power-off, the heater can run at maximum power to burn off soot
  - Configurable duration (default 10 minutes, range 1-30)
  - Previous heating mode (Temperature vs Level) and setpoint are restored immediately before the real off command
  - Enable/disable via `switch.*_burnoff_on_shutdown` (on by default)
  - Duration via `number.*_burnoff_duration` (default 10 minutes)
  - `button.*_power_off_now` skips burn-off and turns the heater off immediately
  - `button.*_run_burnoff` runs max power without shutting down (e.g. weekly clean)
  - In-progress burn-off survives Home Assistant restart
  - Turning the heater on during burn-off cancels the delayed off and restores the previous mode
  - Skipped when the heater is already off, in ECU cooldown, or in ventilation mode
